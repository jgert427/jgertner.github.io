  <h1>Evolutionary Hardware</h1>
  
  <p>If you haven't already looked over the first example, SAGA, 
  it would be a good idea to look it over as the following example does not lend itself to images.</p>
  <p><strong>This last example is about evolutionary hardware, a developing technology that could allow machines to change dynamically and autonomously .</strong></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Like any genetic algorithm the algorithm at work manipulates a population to get the optimal desired result. 
  In this case the population is made up of possible circuit constructs. 
  Each circuit is given a fitness score which tells how well that circuit accomplishes the current goal.
  Depending on the device these configurations are either simulated or physically implemented to test whether it accomplishes the current goal.
  Using the objective functions the device is able to come up with new possible circuits, with crossovers and mutaions</p>
 <p>Evolved hardware is common in devices sent into space. It is vital in solving different problems that such a device may encounter in space. 
 For example, if a probe were to run into unusually high levels of radiation, the radiation could damage some of the circuitry. 
 If this were to happen the algorithm would attempt to find the best replacement circuits for all tasks that required the now dead circuits. 
 This can allow scientists more leeway when trying to design such a device for all variables. 
 All of this requires not only the algorithm but the hardware that can adapt to it, and an AI autonomously detect when new circuits are required.</p>
