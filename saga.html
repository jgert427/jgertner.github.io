  <h1>The Sequence Alignment Genetic Algorithm (SAGA)</h1>
  
  <p>If you have read this far you probably are still unclear as to how exactly a genetic algorithm works. 
  The following is an example of how SAGA, a multiple protein sequence alignment genetic algorithm, works.</p>
  <div class="center">
  <div class="slideshow">

		
		<div>
            <img src="init.jpg" />
            <p><strong>Initialization:</strong> This genetic algorithm, designed to find optimal alignments in mutiple protein sequence alignments,
			begins by creating a random population of 100.
			Each is a random sequences created through a set design. The above example is a sample of 4 such sequences to demonstrate how the algorithm works. 
			</p> 
        </div>
		<div>
            <img src="eval.jpg" />
            <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Each sequence is evaluated and given a fitness score. 
			This score is based off how many proteins in each sequence are aligned, mismatched, as well as the number of gaps. 
			It also takes into account similarity to the other members of the current generation. Duplicates are removed. </p> 
        </div>
		<div>
            <img src="pick.jpg" />
            <p><strong>Selection:</strong>  In each generation of results for this algorithm 50% are kept and form half of them next generation, 
			this is a process known as overlapping generations. 
			What this means is that 50% of alignments move on unchanged based on thier fitness score from the previous step.
			<br><strong>Above:</strong> Sequences with better fitness scores are kept (50%) while the rest are removed.</p> 
        </div>
		<div>
            <img src="cross.jpg" />
            <p><strong>Breeding:</strong> As the previous step stated 50% of each generation is the best of the previous generation. 
			The other half is created by choosing parents to create new sequences. This is accomplished by creating crossovers of the two parent alignments.
			This process increases the diversity of the poulation allowing for a higher likelyhood of reaching the optimal result.
			<br><strong>Above:</strong> The two sequences kept during the previous selection step are used as parents to create 2 new child alignments. 
			The alignments are evaluated and the best one is chosen to be a part of the the next generation.</p> 
        </div>
		<div>
            <img src="mutate.jpg" />
            <p><strong>Mutation:</strong> Mutation is a subsection of the previous step breeding. Like breeding it picks parents at random and creates new child alignments.
			Mutations in this algorithm are created by adding, moving, or removing gaps in any of the sequences, gaps are added at the end to match length as necessary.  
			<br><strong>Above:</strong> Sequence 2 from our orginal alignments is chosen as a parent 
			and a new child sequence is created by adding 2 gaps to two of the sequences, gaps are then added to the end of the remaining sequences to match length.</p> 
        </div>
		<div>
            <p><strong>Termination:</strong> After no improvements have been made in 100 generations the process is terminated and the current answer with the best fitness score is reported as the answer.</p>

	<p><strong>A Detailed Explanation:</strong></p>
	<p>When the algorithm begins it creates a generation 0 containing 100 different alignments. 
	These alignments are created setting a random offset, a number of gaps at the beginning, from 0-50 and then filling in gaps at the end of each sequence to end up with a matching length in each individidual alignment.
	At this step, and every other step that chenages the contents of the current generation, all alignments are checked for duplicates, as duplicates are not allowed.
	Once created they are evaluated with a fitness score. The score is designed to assess the alignments based on a number of criterea including; number of matched, misatched, and gaps as well as similarity to other alignments.
	Once scored the top 50% are kept to become part of the next generation while the bottom are dropped, they can however still be used in the crossover/mutation steps.
	The next step is to repopulate the next generation as only 50% has been decided the other 50% is generated in the crossover/mutation steps. Then the process is repeated until termination.
	</p>
	
	<p>The algorithm is designed to be adaptive enabling it to be adjusted as needed to suit all problems of multiple protein alignment and 
	this is accomplished through the use of what are called objective functions. These are what are used for the crossover/mutation steps.
	In all there are 22 seperate objective functions in this algorithm, each designed to crossover or add, move or remove gaps in different ways. 
	These were designed to optimize the results. It works by dynamically queueing each function and designating each a starting probability of 1/22 of being used.
	Every 10 generations the probabilities are adjusted to favor the functions that have produced the most children, in the current genreation.
	To stop the removal of a function that could prove useful later each function has a minimum probability of half its starting probability (1/44).</p>
	
	<p>Without setting a termination condition a genetic algorithm can theoretically go on infinitely. 
	This alogrithm, like many other genetic algorithms, determines termination occurs if no improvement has been made over a set number of generations, in this case 100.
	If no improvement has been made in the last 100 generations then it is decided the current answer with the best fitness score is the optimal alignment. </p>
	
	<p>Overall this algorithm is shown to be quite useful as it can match and in some cases outperform its most used competitors, MSA and CLUSTAL W. 
	These cases of outperformance tend to be cases with longer sequences as MSA and CLUSTAL W are not as good at handling longer sequences, especially MSA.
	Its memory usage is minimal as the only thing that needs to be stored is the current generation; 
	even in a case with 10 sequences of average length 200 and a population size of 100, about 1Mb is sufficient enough memory.
	As far as run time compared to it's biggest competitors it is clearly slower by a large margin.
	Overall it is statistaclly better in terms of results by a small margin and due to its design it can be easily adjusted if the current iteration does not suit the needs of the user.</p>
